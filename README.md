# devcroft

Isolated, reproducible development environments built on OS-level sandboxing
— kernel primitives instead of containers or VMs — each reachable over SSH.

Many environments, including fleets of coding agents, run in parallel on one
host at near-zero marginal cost: they share a single content-addressed Nix
store while each stays behind its own kernel-enforced boundary. Because every
sandbox speaks SSH, existing editors work unchanged.

devcroft implements no isolation itself. It is a policy compiler, a
supervisor, and an SSH endpoint over existing sandbox backends.

## Status

**MVP implementation underway — 10/25 tasks.** The fd-passing keeper trick
(spike binary, task group 1) is proven on both Linux/Landlock and
macOS/Seatbelt; the config/policy compiler, the environment provider layer
(`flox` resolution, task group 3), and the keeper's spawn protocol (control
socket, session registry, pty allocation — task 4.1) are implemented and
tested. There is no `devcroft` CLI binary or SSH endpoint yet, and the
keeper isn't wired to a supervisor (`up`/`down`/`rm`) — those are task
groups 4.2 onward and 6. User-facing documentation is written at release
(task 7.4); until then the specs are the source of truth.
